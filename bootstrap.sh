# When using service command it says "Failed to get D-Bus connection: Operation not permitted"
# There is 3 ways to work around this phenomenon.
# 1. Use /sbin/init and let the service start from it.
# 2. Run docker with --privileged option.
# 3. Avoid using service command and just use the daemon script directly
# And my choice is 3. because the feature provided in service command is not actually needed at this morment.
